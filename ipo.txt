Command Line Interface Algorithm

The input will be a number that someone writes. No matter what number it is, it will have to be converted into a Double, if the input is not a number it will be discarded and the user will have another chance to put in a number. First the program will print a line telling the user to put a piece of data in. Then once the person has put the piece of data and presses enter it will loop again until they exit the loop pressing some sort of exit word or character, all the data collected will be put into a array. Then thew rest of a program will take over performing its functions on the array that the interface has collected.
