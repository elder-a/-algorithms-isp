The input will be a number that someone writes. No matter what number it is, it will have to be converted into a Double. First the program will print a line telling the user to put a piece of data in. Then once the person has put the piece of data and presses enter it will loop again until they exit the loop pressing Q all the data collected will be put into a array.
